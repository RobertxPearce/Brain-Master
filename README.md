# Brain-Master: LED Sequence Memorization Game
Project for the AISL Vegas STEM Lab program at UNLV.

# Goal:
To utilize a digital system for saving and retrieving data as part of the game logic.

# Activity:
1) Students will program multiple switches for a physical computing game.
2) The group will control multiple LEDs corresponding to the input switches.
3) The group will create game logic that displays different patterns.

# Opportunity:
Memory games are often used as an exercise to improve memory, concentration, and pattern recognition skills. Creating this memory game can be a way to develop and enhance these abilities. Creating a memory game allows for innovation and creativity in game design. We can experiment with different features, levels, and gameplay mechanics to make their game unique and engaging.
