# Brain-Master: LED Sequence Memorization Game
Project for the Vegas STEM program at UNLV.


# Goal:
To utilize a digital system for saving and retrieving data as part of the game logic.

# Activity:
1) A group of students will program multiple switches for a physical computing game.
2) The group will control multiple LEDs corresponding to the input switches.
3) The group will create game logic that displays different patterns.

# Opportunity:
This project offers a group to design and implement game logic using a microcontroller. The project provides visually engaging experience to test players' reflexes.

# Mentor requirement:
ESP32 programming

# Mentor: 
Robert Pearce
